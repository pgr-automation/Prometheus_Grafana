# Prometheus Architecture

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. This document provides an overview of its architecture.

## Overview

Prometheus operates on a pull-based model, where it scrapes metrics from various targets, processes and stores them, and provides a powerful query language (PromQL) for analysis.

## Components

### 1. Prometheus Server
- **Scraping:** The server periodically scrapes metrics from instrumented applications and services (targets) over HTTP.
- **Storage:** Metrics data is stored in a time-series database (TSDB) on the local disk. Prometheus uses a custom format optimized for fast retrieval and efficient storage.
- **Querying:** Prometheus provides PromQL, a flexible query language, to retrieve and analyze stored metrics. The results can be used for visualization, alerting, or integrations.

### 2. Targets
- Targets are endpoints that expose metrics in a format Prometheus can scrape. These could be applications, databases, or other systems.
- Targets are discovered via service discovery mechanisms like Kubernetes, Consul, or static configurations.

### 3. Prometheus Pushgateway
- The Pushgateway allows short-lived jobs to push metrics to Prometheus. This is useful for jobs that are too short-lived to be scraped directly.
- It acts as an intermediary, storing metrics temporarily until they are scraped by Prometheus.

### 4. Alertmanager
- Alertmanager handles alerts generated by the Prometheus server. It deduplicates, groups, and routes alerts to various notification channels like email, Slack, or PagerDuty.
- It supports silencing and inhibition rules to manage alert noise.

### 5. Exporters
- Exporters act as intermediaries between Prometheus and non-instrumented applications or systems.
- They convert metrics from various sources (like databases, hardware, or third-party APIs) into a format Prometheus can understand.

### 6. Service Discovery
- Prometheus supports multiple service discovery mechanisms, including static configuration, DNS SRV records, Consul, Kubernetes, EC2, etc.
- This allows Prometheus to dynamically discover and scrape new targets as they come online.

### 7. Prometheus Federation
- Federation allows you to scale Prometheus by federating multiple Prometheus servers. One server can scrape another Prometheus serverâ€™s metrics, enabling hierarchical monitoring setups.

### 8. Visualization
- Prometheus integrates well with visualization tools like Grafana, which can query Prometheus and create dashboards to visualize metrics data.

## Summary

Prometheus architecture is modular and designed for flexibility, enabling it to scale from single-node setups to large, multi-region deployments. Its pull-based model, coupled with powerful querying and alerting capabilities, makes it a robust solution for monitoring and alerting in dynamic environments.
